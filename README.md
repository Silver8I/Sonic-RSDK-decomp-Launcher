# Sonic-RSDK-decomp-Launcher

This is a launcher for the RSDK Decompilations made by Rubberduckycooly and st√ótic.
Curently it only works on Windows i do have plans to port it to Linux and add a GUI.
You can build it with the GCC compiler from MinGW.
To set it up make this folder structure:
+ (the compiled executable)
+ RSDKv3
  * Sonic CD
    * RSDKv3.exe
    * Data.rsdk
+ RSDKv4
  * Sonic 1
    * RSDKv4.exe
    * Data.rsdk
  * Sonic 2
    * RSDKv4.exe
    * Data.rsdk
+ RSDKv5
  * Sonic Mania
    * RSDKv5U.exe
    * Data.rsdk
    * Game.dll
